#Online Banking System
Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive online banking system designed to handle a variety of banking operations digitally, facilitating ease of access and management for both customers and bank staff. It incorporates several key modules including Personal Financial Management, Bill Payment, Donations, and a robust Credit and Loans management system.

Theme
The system is intended to serve daily banking needs without requiring physical bank visits, integrating functionalities such as checking balances, making payments, transferring funds, and more, all through a user-friendly online interface.

Case Description
The use case follows a typical end-of-month scenario where a user checks for salary deposits, pays bills, manages emergencies, and even handles unexpected financial challenges such as currency devaluation. This scenario is used to highlight and test the system's capabilities in managing complex, real-life financial situations efficiently.
